<h1>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A GENERAL SURGEON?</h1>
General surgeons employ a wide range of knowledge and skills to perform surgery, often in emergency situations. These surgical procedures are carried out to remove disease, repair injuries, and promote health and healing. They also perform diagnostic tests and provide guidance on the need for surgery. These doctors might be called on to perform surgery on almost any part of the body.<br>

The surgeon takes a medical history and performs a detailed physical examination of the patient, then makes a diagnosis based on the information obtained. A treatment plan specific to the patient is then developed to incorporate the findings.<br>
