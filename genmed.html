<h1>WHAT IS GENERAL MEDICINE?</h1>
General Medicine is also referred to as Internal Medicine, this medical specialty deals with preventing, diagnosing and the non-surgical treatments of diseases that are related to the internal organs in adults. General medicine covers the vast majority of hospital-based specialties.<br>

The care begins with diagnosis, resulting in a planned treatment schedule and regular monitoring leading to recuperation. A whole host of ailments are treated including conditions that affect the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, haematological or endocrine systems.<br><br>

<h1>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A GENERAL PHYSICIAN?</h1>
General Physicians are highly trained specialists who provide a range of non-surgical health care to adult patients. They care for difficult, serious or unusual medical problems and continue to treat the patient until these problems have resolved or stabilised. With a vast understanding of the human body and range of treatments, General Physicians differ from other specialists who limit their medical practice to problems involving only one body system or to a special area of medical knowledge.<br>

A GP begins assesment by asking the patient about current symptoms, their onset, duration, character, relieving and exacerbating factors and previous tests and treatments. Other medical problems, medications, allergies, social and family history are also considered as important points of reference.<br>

General physicians can arrange a diverse range of tests to ascertain the patient’s condition and confirm their clinical suspicion. These may include bedside tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis (U/A), blood sugar level, blood pressure, faecal occult blood test. Occasionally a biopsy or small piece of tissue is required for diagnosis. Imaging done by radiologists like X-Rays, CT scans, ultrasound or MRI are also used in some cases.<br>
